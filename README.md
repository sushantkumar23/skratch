# Skratch

Skratch is a research framework for fast prototyping of reinforcement learning
algorithms in the trading domain. It aims to fill the need for a robust, fast,
and structured testing of agents on trading environment for faster
experimentation.

Our design principles are:

* _Easy experimentation_: Make it easy for new users to run benchmark
                          experiments.
* _Flexible development_: Make it easy for new users to try out new strategies
                          ideas.
* _Compact and reliable_: Provide implementations for a few, battle-tested
                          algorithms.
* _Reproducible_: Facilitate reproducibility in results. In particular, our
                  setup follows the recommendations given by
                  [Machado et al. (2018)][machado].
